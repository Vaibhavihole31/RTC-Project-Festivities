<p> NPK fertilizer is usually used to increase the growth of a plant. The N element in NPK fertilizer has the function of preparing amino acids (proteins), nucleic acids, nucleotides, and chlorophyll in plants. 
  The element P in the NPK fertilizer has a function as a storage and energy transfer.</p>

    N-P-K release
Our organic fertilizers have homogeneous nutritional values. As an example we have our own brand
 FERTISOL organic fertilizers with an average N-P-K content of . Our 
 fertilizer works with the “slow release” principle. After spreading, the nutrients
  will be released slowly and not at once, because the soil releases the nutrients.
   As a result, the organic fertilizer pellets have a long-lasting effect and it means 
   a constant stream of nutrients towards the crop and the soil. It differs per nutrient how much will be released and the period in which it will be released. Find out more about how plant 
nutrition works and how our organic fertilizers contribute to plant growth.
